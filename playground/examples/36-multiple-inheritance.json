  "description": "BPL supports multiple inheritance, allowing a struct to extend multiple parent structs. Syntax: struct Child extends Parent1, Parent2. The child inherits all fields and methods from all parents. If parents have methods with the same name, the child can override them or the first parent's version is used. Multiple inheritance enables composition-like patterns and mixin functionality. However, it increases complexity - watch for diamond problem scenarios (two parents share a grandparent). Consider composition (embedding structs as fields) as an alternative for simpler designs. This example demonstrates multiple inheritance, field/method access, and override behavior.",
