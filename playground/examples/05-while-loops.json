  "description": "BPL uses the 'loop' keyword instead of 'while'. A loop with a condition executes repeatedly as long as the condition evaluates to true. The condition is checked before each iteration (pre-test loop). An infinite loop is created with 'loop { }' without a condition. Use 'break' to exit a loop early and 'continue' to skip to the next iteration. Loop variables can be declared outside the loop (accessible after) or inside the initialization part of a for-style loop (scoped to the loop). This example shows countdown logic and condition-based iteration.",
