## [9] Source Code Display for Eval/Stdin Errors

**Description:** Fix error message code snippets when compiling from stdin (`--stdin`) or eval mode (`-e`). Currently, when an error occurs in code compiled from these sources, the error formatter attempts to read the source from a file that doesn't exist or accidentally reads binary data from compiled executables with similar names (e.g., `stdin-42069`), resulting in garbled output.

**The Problem:**

When using `--stdin` or `-e`, the compiler assigns fake file paths like `stdin-42069` or `eval-42069` to track the source. However, the `CompilerError` class tries to read these as real files to display code snippets. This causes:

1. Binary data display when a compiled executable with that name exists
2. Empty/missing code snippets when no file exists
3. Poor user experience for interactive/piped compilation

**Implementation Notes:**

There are several approaches to fix this:

**Option 1: Thread source through CompilerError (Preferred)**

- Modify `CompilerError` constructor to accept optional `sourceLines: string[]` parameter
- When compiling from stdin/eval, capture the source and pass it to error constructors
- Store source in a global context or thread it through the compilation pipeline
- Modify all places that create `CompilerError` to optionally provide source

**Option 2: Source cache by file path**

- Create a global `SourceCache` that maps file paths to source content
- When compiling stdin/eval, register the source in the cache with the fake path
- Modify `CompilerError.loadSourceLines()` to check the cache before reading from disk
- Clear cache after compilation to avoid memory leaks

**Option 3: Virtual file system**

- Create an abstraction layer for file reading that supports "virtual" files
- Register stdin/eval sources as virtual files in this system
- Update all file reading throughout the compiler to use this abstraction

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Errors from `bpl --stdin` display the actual source code line with proper highlighting
- Errors from `bpl -e "code"` show the code that was passed
- No binary data or garbled text appears in error messages
- Column indicators (^^^) correctly point to error locations
- Solution doesn't significantly complicate the codebase
- Memory usage remains reasonable (no unbounded caching)
