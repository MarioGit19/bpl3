## Pending Features (expanded)

- [1] Advanced Generics (Constraints, Inference)
  - Description: Add generic constraints (e.g., `T: Comparable`) and local inference so generic functions can deduce type parameters from call-sites where possible.
  - Implementation notes: Extend type parameter structures to include bounds; implement constraint checking during type inference/resolution. Add unification and constraint propagation algorithm to TypeChecker.
  - Acceptance criteria: Constrained generics accept only types satisfying bounds; generic functions without explicit type args can be called with types that infer correctly.

- [1] Operator Overloading for User Types
  - Description: Let user-defined types implement special methods (dunder-style like `__add__`, `__eq__`) that override built-in operator behavior for instances.
  - Implementation notes: Define mapping between operators and method names; during type-checking, if an operand type has the corresponding method, resolve to that method; otherwise fall back to builtin semantics. Disallow assignment operators overloading. Ensure overload resolution supports left/right operand dispatch and coercions.
  - Acceptance criteria: Defining `__add__` on a struct causes `a + b` to call that method; operator resolution respects type conversions and produces helpful errors when ambiguous.

- [3] Root Global `Type` Struct
  - Description: Define a root `Type` struct that every user-defined struct implicitly inherits from, providing methods like `getTypeName()`, `getSize()`, `toString()`, and basic equality.
  - Implementation notes: Add injection of implicit base for every struct during parsing/semantic analysis. Implement common methods as part of the runtime/stdlib. Ensure virtual dispatch works (method overriding) if language supports it.
  - Acceptance criteria: Any struct can call `getTypeName()`; common operations are available without explicit inheritance in source.

- [3] Primitive Types as Structs Inheriting `Primitive`
  - Description: Model primitive types (int, float, bool, char) as structs inheriting from a `Primitive` base, exposing operations as methods to unify the type system.
  - Implementation notes: Represent primitives specially in the type system but provide method dispatch wrappers so code like `int_val.toString()` is valid. Balance performance (inlined primitives) with uniformity (object-like methods).
  - Acceptance criteria: Primitive methods are callable and interoperate with language operators; performance-sensitive paths remain efficient.

- [3] Multi-Target Support
  - Description: Add support for targeting multiple platforms and architectures (x86/x64/ARM) and provide conditional std lib methods for platform differences.
  - Implementation notes: Abstract target-specific codegen paths and provide a target triple input. Maintain a small set of runtime abstractions for syscalls/ABI.
  - Acceptance criteria: Codegen can emit different target outputs and small example programs run on at least two targets.

- [5] Type Narrowing / Pattern Matching
  - Description: Implement syntax and semantics for narrowing variable types based on runtime checks (useful inside `catch` blocks or generic contexts).
  - Implementation notes: Add a `match<T>(expr)` AST construct and TypeChecker rules to narrow variable types inside block scope. Ensure RTTI support for runtime checks.
  - Acceptance criteria: Within a `match<T>(v)` block, `v` has type `T` and member accesses/overloads resolve accordingly.

- [5] Linting Tool
  - Description: Provide static analysis tooling to detect style and potential bugs (unused vars, suspicious casts, missing returns.)
  - Implementation notes: Reuse AST and TypeChecker. Make rules configurable and add autofix for simple cases.
  - Acceptance criteria: Linter runs and reports actionable warnings; some autofixes available.

- [5] Documentation Generation Tool
  - Description: Tool to parse source comments and generate API docs (HTML/Markdown) for language, libraries, and runtime.
  - Implementation notes: Reuse the parser/AST to extract doc comments and signatures. Provide templates and command-line options for output formats. Consider output used by IDE tooltips. Similar to JSDoc/Doxygen.
  - Acceptance criteria: Running the doc tool outputs a readable API doc set for the std lib and sample modules.

- [6] Allow Structs to Inherit Primitives
  - Description: Permit `struct MyInt : int { ... }` so a struct can behave as a primitive type with additional methods/fields.
  - Implementation notes: Carefully design memory layout and type compatibility: instances of `MyInt` must be usable where `int` is expected. Implement implicit conversion rules and method overriding semantics. Consider specialization in codegen for performance.
  - Acceptance criteria: `MyInt` instances can be passed to APIs expecting `int`; overrides of primitive methods are callable.

- [8] Const Correctness
  - Description: Enforce `const` (or equivalent) declarations and immutability rules across the language: constant variables, read-only fields, `const` parameters, and compile-time constants. Ensure the compiler prevents mutation of `const` values and accepts usage patterns that are safe.
  - Implementation notes: Add `isConst` flag to symbol/type entries. Propagate const through assignments, parameter passing, and returns. Treat `const` references to mutable objects as shallowly const unless a deeper const model is chosen. Decide whether `const` applies to variables, fields, and/or function returns.
  - Acceptance criteria: Examples declaring `const` variables produce errors on mutation; `const` parameters cannot be assigned inside functions; `const` globals evaluate as compile-time constants where used.

- [8] Async/Await
  - Description: Add `async` functions and `await` operator with promise-like semantics to simplify asynchronous programming.
  - Implementation notes: Decide whether to transpile async into callback-based state machines or use runtime coroutines. Provide runtime for futures/promises and event loop integration.
  - Acceptance criteria: `async` functions return a `Future`/`Promise` type and `await` suspends/resumes correctly in examples.

- [8] Threading Support
  - Description: Provide language primitives to create and manage threads, synchronization primitives, and safe concurrency patterns.
  - Implementation notes: Integrate with target threading primitives (pthreads on POSIX). Define memory model and synchronization primitives (mutex, atomic ops).
  - Acceptance criteria: Spawn, join threads, and synchronized access examples behave correctly.

- [8] Inline Assembly Blocks
  - Description: Allow embedding inline assembly with explicit register lists and integration with calling conventions.
  - Implementation notes: Add parser support and a safe lowered representation. During codegen, inject asm inline properly and validate register usage.
  - Acceptance criteria: `asm [rax, rbx] { rdrand rax\n mov rbx, rax\n mov (variable), rbx }` compiles and emits inline assembly; constraints are documented.

- [9] Semantic Analysis Improvements
  - Description: Enhance the TypeChecker and semantic analysis to catch more errors at compile time, such as unreachable code, variable shadowing, and unused variables.
  - Implementation notes: Add passes for control flow analysis (reachability) and scope analysis (shadowing).
  - Acceptance criteria: Compiler warns or errors on unreachable code and shadowed variables.
